"""
Build a super dumb iterator wrapper which then returns a progress, this should be kinda splitted
first we need an object which remains alive the whole time where the logic and the variables are set to know
where the progress should be displayed (in our case we set in the gui, that we want the progress bar to be updated)

The second part is the iterator which only needs to be alive during "work"

thats how an iterator is made: https://treyhunner.com/2018/06/how-to-make-an-iterator-in-python/



this should probably be in an extra package since tqdm is used in the unet_pytorch package and we should not create
circular dependencies between the packages


the persistent class could have a private class which is the iterator and a method for creating the iterator
