[iPython Notebook for getting started with Siam U-Net](https://github.com/danihae/bio-image-unet/blob/master/using_siam_unet.ipynb)

### Documentation

TBD

## TODO

### Before publication time
Download some open dataset for tissue segmentation on the Internet and include it with our package. 

### Testing plan 1
Generate test dataset.
One image from each project.
Run test dataset.

### Testing plan 2
Just run model for all the images in their respective dataset.
